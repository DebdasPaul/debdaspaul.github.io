Welcome to my homepage! 

I am a postdoctoral scientist at the [Leibniz Institute on Aging](https://www.leibniz-fli.de/) in [Prof. Alessandro Cellerino's](https://www.leibniz-fli.de/research/associated-research-groups/cellerino) group. I develop and apply machine learning models to understand the biology of aging. Before joining the Leibniz Institute on Aging, I worked with [Dr. Juliane Liepe](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de/liepe) at MPI-NAT in Göttingen and [Prof. Dr. Manfred Classen](https://claassenlab.github.io/people/manfred-claassen/) at the University Hospital in Tübingen, Germany.

I studied computer science and engineering. As student of computer science, I worked on the application of spectral graph theory- especially on the bipartite structures. This resulted into two independent collaborations with [Prof. Steve Kirkland](https://server.math.umanitoba.ca/~kirkland/) and with [Prof. Dragan Stevanovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dragan-stevanovic-2222977/)

Later in my career, I moved to computational and systems biology. I completed my second masters with a thesis in theoretical biological physics under [Prof. Stefan Engblom](https://stefanengblom.github.io//) studying how to effectively reduce expensive computation of exact chemical master equation using different pre-conditioning schemes.

I completed my doctoral studies under [Prof. Nicole Radde](https://www.isa.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Radde-00003/) at the [Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control](https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany. 
My research focused on uncovering the mechanisms underlying robust and reliable signal propagation in biological signaling networks, employing methodologies from dynamical systems theory, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic analysis, and rule-based modeling. As part of this work, I also conducted research as a visiting scientist in the [Gunawardena lab](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/jeremy-gunawardena) at the Harvard Medical School. 


During my free time, I enjoy reading, photography, hiking, and traveling.
