Welcome to my homepage! 

I am a postdoctoral scientist at the [Leibniz Institute on Aging](https://www.leibniz-fli.de/) in Jena, Germany.

I was trained as computer science engineer back in India. During my training in computer science, my research primarily centered on the analysis of bipartite structures using techniques from spectral graph theory. 

My fascination with the complexities of natural systems, developed during my master’s studies, motivated me to transition into the field of Systems Biology. I pursued a second master's degree through a joint program between Aalto University (Finland) and KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden), where I was introduced to the application of computer science and mathematics in solving biological problems. I subsequently completed my master’s thesis in theoretical biological physics under the supervision of [Prof. Stefan Engblom](https://stefanengblom.github.io//) in the Department of Scientific Computing at Uppsala University, Sweden. There I studied parameter inference for stochastic chemical kinetics using the [chemical master equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_equation).

Continuing my journey in Systems Biology, I pursued my doctoral studies under [Prof. Nicole Radde](https://www.isa.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Radde-00003/) at the [Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control](https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany. My research focused on uncovering the mechanisms underlying robust and reliable signal propagation in biological signaling networks, employing methodologies from dynamical systems theory, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic analysis, and rule-based modeling. As part of this work, I also conducted research as a visiting scientist in the [Gunawardena lab](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/jeremy-gunawardena) at the Harvard Medical School. 

During my postdoctoral career at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen and at the University Hospital in Tübingen, I transitioned towards more data-driven approaches, applying machine learning techniques to clinical problems such as the identification of biomarkers from high-throughput cytometry data.

In my current role, I am leading a [project](https://www.go-bio.de/gobio/de/gefoerderte-projekte/gobio-initial/_documents/MOMAC.html) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), where I am developing deep learning models to evaluate aging interventions in animal models.


Apart from computer science and systems biology, I possess a great interest in quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and human history.

During my free time, I enjoy reading, photography, hiking, and traveling.
